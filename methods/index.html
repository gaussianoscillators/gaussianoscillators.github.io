<p>How can we visualize a probability distribution of functions?</p>
<p>One way is <em>animations</em>. Each frame shows a single function: a single sample from the distribution. Consecutive frames are <em>correlated</em>, so that the function appears to move. The vertical motion indicates the magnitude of the uncertainty at a point. The horizontal structure shows how different points are related to each other for functions in the distribution.</p>
<p>Not all animation techniques are equally effective. This page compares different techniques: beginning with the pre-existing approaches, and working towards a new method which combines the best features of all.</p>
<p>(Every figure visualizes the same distribution: a Squared Exponential covariance, with hyperparameters <span class="math inline">\(\left(\ell = 1, \sigma = 1\right)\)</span>.)</p>
<h2 id="interpolation">Interpolation</h2>
<p>This method starts with a sequence of <em>independent</em> samples from the distribution. We then interpolate between neighboring samples, keeping the marginal distribution the same at all times.</p>
<p>(In other words: <em>any</em> individual frame -- even an interpolated one -- shows a sample from the distribution.)</p>
<div id="chart_interp">

</div>
<p>The main disadvantage is that the <em>keyframes</em> -- i.e., the frames with the original, independent samples -- are treated specially. Each keyframe exhibits a distracting &quot;jerk&quot; in the motion, as the function pivots to move towards the next keyframe.</p>
<h2 id="great-circles">Great Circles</h2>
<p><em>Great circles</em> are an alternative method which corrects the deficiencies of interpolation. Their motion is perfectly smooth. Moreover, every frame is exactly equivalent to every other frame.</p>
<p>This method works by producing a great circle in <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-dimensional space (where <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the number of points in the curve). Both the radius of the circle and its orientation are random.</p>
<div id="chart_great_circle">

</div>
<p>This method exhibits more fluid and appealing motion, but it has a number of disadvantages.</p>
<p>First, it repeats itself, so that any given animation only visualizes a small fraction of the distribution. (By contrast, the interpolation method can continuously generate new curves, and explore more and more of the distribution over time.)</p>
<p>Second, circular paths are strongly <em>time-anticorrelated</em>. This means that whatever curve we see, we will soon see its &quot;opposite&quot;. (In the case of zero-mean priors, as on this page, this means we will see the exact negative -- watch it and see!)</p>
<h2 id="delocalized-oscillators">Delocalized oscillators</h2>
<p>This more flexible method contains the Great Circles method above as a special case. The motion is still perfectly smooth. However, it can be extended for longer time periods and take more complicated paths, visualizing much more of the distribution.</p>
<div id="chart_loop">

</div>
<p>The downside is that it still eventually repeats. Moreover, the resource requirements are <em>quadratic</em> in the length of the animation (<span class="math inline">\(O(t^2)\)</span>)! This creates an unfortunate tension: we want longer animations (because they show more of the distribution), but the resource requirements quickly become unmanageable.</p>
<h2 id="compact-support-covariance-oscillators">Compact support covariance oscillators</h2>
<p>The method of <em>compact support covariance</em> combines the advantages of the above techniques, without the drawbacks. In this method, each frame is correlated only with other frames within a certain time window, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>. This correlation function is smooth everywhere; therefore, so is the motion. Furthermore, although no frames are treated specially in any way (as with great circles and delocalized oscillators), we can continue to generate new frames with constant resource requirements (<span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, as with interpolation).</p>
<div id="chart_CS">

</div>
<p>The resulting function does not journey from one discrete keyframe to the next, nor does it ever repeat its position. Rather, it simply evolves. It takes a smooth, beautiful path through <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-dimensional space, exploring more and more of the distribution as time goes on. The viewer of this function can understand the distribution it represents simply by watching it move.</p>
<h2 id="other-distributions">Other distributions</h2>
<p>Of course, we could have visualized other distributions too.</p>
<p>For example, consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat%C3%A9rn_covariance_function">family of Matérn covariance functions</a>. They are categorized by an additional hyperparameter <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>, which <a href="http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gpip/slides/rasmussen.pdf">governs the degree of smoothness</a>. The <span class="math inline">\(\nu = \frac{1}{2}\)</span> case is equivalent to the Exponential covariance, while <span class="math inline">\(\nu \rightarrow \infty\)</span> is equivalent to the Squared Exponential covariance we've been visualizing above.</p>
<p>On this page, you can change the covariance on the fly to see how different members of the Matérn family behave. Pressing <code>1</code> will show the <span class="math inline">\(\nu = \frac{1}{2}\)</span> case (i.e., the exponential). <code>2</code> will show <span class="math inline">\(\nu = \frac{3}{2}\)</span>, <code>3</code> will show <span class="math inline">\(\nu = \frac{5}{2}\)</span>, and <code>4</code> will return to the Squared Exponential (<span class="math inline">\(\nu \rightarrow \infty\)</span>) we've already been visualizing.</p>
<p>I particularly recommend going up and down the &quot;ladder&quot; -- going from 1 up to 3, and back -- to get a feel for the effect of <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>. The functions are fairly similar, but more (1) or less (3) jaggy.</p>
<p>Happy viewing!</p>
